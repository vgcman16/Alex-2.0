# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering a contribution! Please follow these steps to get started:

1. **Fork the repo** on GitHub and create a feature branch.
2. **Install dependencies** using `npm install` and `cd app && npm install`.
3. **Run the tests** with `npm test` to ensure everything passes.
4. Make your changes with clear commits.
5. Open a pull request targeting the `main` branch. Include a summary of your changes.

We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for the test suite and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before submitting your PR.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of how the pieces fit together.
